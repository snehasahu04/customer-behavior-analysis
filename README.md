Customer behavior insights through SQL-based analysis, Python EDA, and interactive Power BI dashboards

# Customer Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior to uncover meaningful patterns and insights using SQL, Python, and Power BI. The goal is to support data-driven business decisions by understanding customer preferences and purchasing trends.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Write SQL queries for data extraction and aggregation
- Create interactive dashboards using Power BI
- Present insights in a clear and business-friendly manner

## 🗂 Dataset
- Customer shopping behavior dataset containing demographic and transaction details
- Data preprocessing and cleaning performed using Python and SQL

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- **Power BI** (Dashboard creation and visualization)

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Python
2. Performed EDA to understand trends and patterns
3. Executed SQL queries for data analysis and aggregation
4. Imported processed data into Power BI
5. Built interactive dashboards and reports

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
- Customer demographics analysis
- Purchase and spending trends
- Category-wise sales analysis
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
